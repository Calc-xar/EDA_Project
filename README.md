# EDA_Project
Collaborated with a classmate on this project. (Name is on the documents).
This project is about understanding what Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is and how to do it using python.
In this project I used a dataset in regards to Covid-19 cases. 

1. We saw visualized the dataset.
2. We cleaned the dataset.
3. We selected the columns to use for our models (We used a Decision tree & ensemble(Random Forest) model to predict them classes of each patient with the selected columns.)
4. We showed our results.
